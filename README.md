Submission for assignment 1, INFO 474, University of Washington, Winter 2018

### Note: This is a revised submission.  The original visualization,
### "Homework Number One" (given as a JPEG and PDF), has been modified
### to use a logarithmic scale.  An indication that the scale is now
### logarithmic has been given in the title of the visualization.  The
### original visualization was created programmatically with R.  There
### is also now an alternative visualization created with Tableau.  See
### "Minimimum Inhibitory Concentration (MIC) in Base 10 Log Scale."
### This is also supplied in JPEG and PDF formats.  The merits of both
### designs are discussed in the writeup.
